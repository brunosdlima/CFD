This Matlab script solves the Navier Stokes equations in two dimensions for a bluff body imersed on a chanel.
The main simplifications are as follows:
Fully developed flow;
Incompressible Fluid;
Two-dimensional flow;
Conservation of mass in the channel (x axis);
Symmetry in the upper and lower boundaries;
Velocity entrance on the left and outelt on the right;
The fluid is initially quiescent;
Isothermal flow.

For discretization, the displaced mesh method will be used.

To determine the time evolution of the pressure field, the Fractional Step Method will be used, which consists of a non-iterative way to solve the Navier-Stokes equations. 
In this method, the equations of motion are solved for the velocity components and the Poisson equation is solved for the pressure.
The algorithm is divided in five step:
1 - Estimate the velocities u and v;
2 - Estimate the pressure;
3 - Correct the estimated velocities and pressure;
4 - Check conservation of mass;
5 - Advance to the next time step.

The main results are summarized in five figures (Running "Fluiddynamic.m" in the same folder as "Step1.m", "Step2.m" ...):
1 - Velocity field in x direction
2 - Velocity field in y direction
3 - Pressure field
4 - Vorticity
5 - Velocity vector and streamlines

A message pops up on the screen saying that the mass is still not conserved, meaning that the algorithm will keep runing.
