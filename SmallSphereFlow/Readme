The motion of small spherical particles in a cellular flow field (MatLab file)

This routine simulates the behavior of particles with different Stokes numbers in the flow defined in the article by (Maxey, 1987). 
To this end, three different directories are created where images are saved and a sixty-second video with the movement of particles for each Stokes number is generated. 
This procedure is automated by the script.
To implement the numerical solution in Matlab software, Euler's method was used to solve the differential equations.
This same methodology was used in a work similar to that of (Dapena, 2015)
